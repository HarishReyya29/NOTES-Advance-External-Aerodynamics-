# NOTES-Advance-External-Aerodynamics-
This repository contains comprehensive notes on Advanced External Aerodynamics, compiled during the Master's coursework in Aerospace Propulsion. The material serves as a deep dive into the physical principles, analytical techniques, and computational methods used to understand and predict external aerodynamic flows.

✍️ Topics Covered
Inviscid flow theory and potential flow analysis

Thin airfoil theory and lifting-line theory

Panel methods for 2D and 3D flows

Supersonic and hypersonic external flows

Shock-boundary layer interaction

Transonic aerodynamics and compressibility effects

Boundary layer theory and separation

Vortex dynamics and wake behavior

CFD approaches to external flows (RANS, LES)

📚 Highlights
Derivations of core equations (e.g., Prandtl’s lifting line, compressible Bernoulli)

Hand-written notes, formula summaries, and solved examples

Reference to classical theories and modern computational methods

Ideal for exam prep, interview readiness, and research foundation
